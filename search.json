By simulating different network structures and varying levels of neighbour influence, the research aims to assess how these factors affect causal estimates and find method to correct for the biases."

Results showed that there is a negative connection between the share of news about the E.U. and indicators of Russian economy.\nPresented in the XXIII Yasin (April) International Academic Conference on Economic and Social Development, HSE (2022) and International Conference on Computational Social Science, ETH Zurich (2021)\n\n\nMeasuring public opinion in Russia through analysis of online petitions on change.org\nPredicting petition’s popularity by its topics and named entities.
